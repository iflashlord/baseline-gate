# Fixed Issues Summary

## Issues Addressed

### 1. ✅ Fixed "Open In Editor" Button
**Problem**: The "Open In Editor" button was not working to open files at specific locations.

**Solution**: 
- Replaced inline `onclick` handlers with data attributes for better event handling
- Updated JavaScript to use event delegation with `data-action` attributes
- Fixed file opening to properly navigate to the specific line and character position
- Added proper error handling for file opening operations

**Files Modified**: 
- `src/sidebar/detailView.ts` - Updated button HTML and JavaScript event handlers

### 2. ✅ Added Resource Links from Hover Details
**Problem**: Resource links that were available in hover tooltips were missing from the main detail view.

**Solution**:
- Imported `buildResourceLinks` function from hover render components
- Added a new "Resources" section to the detail view with all available links
- Converted markdown links to proper HTML links for webview compatibility
- Added styling for resource links with hover effects and external link indicators
- Implemented proper event handling for both command links and external URLs

**Resources Now Available**:
- Documentation links
- Specification URLs (from W3C, WHATWG, etc.)
- Can I Use links
- Baseline guides
- Discouraged feature sources

**Files Modified**:
- `src/sidebar/analysis/html.ts` - Added resource links generation
- `src/sidebar/detailView.ts` - Added resource link styles and event handling

### 3. ✅ Added Retry Button for Failed Chat Queries
**Problem**: When chat queries failed, users had no way to retry without re-typing their question.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced error message display with structured error UI
- Added a "Retry" button that appears when queries fail
- Implemented retry functionality that stores the last failed query
- Added proper state management to handle retry operations
- Improved error styling with VS Code theme integration

**Features Added**:
- Visual error messages with retry button
- Automatic retry with the same query
- Proper loading state management during retry
- Enhanced error UI with icons and structured layout

**Files Modified**:
- `src/sidebar/detailView.ts` - Added retry button functionality and error handling

### 4. ✅ Fixed Context Expansion Issue
**Problem**: The context section couldn't be expanded to see context details.

**Solution**:
- Consolidated duplicate event handlers that were conflicting
- Fixed the context toggle implementation with proper icon updates
- Ensured proper DOM element selection and state management
- Added proper expand/collapse functionality with visual feedback

**Features Fixed**:
- Context toggle now properly expands/collapses
- Toggle icon changes from ▶ to ▼ when expanded
- Context details show target, feature name, and file path
- Proper event handling without conflicts

**Files Modified**:
- `src/sidebar/detailView.ts` - Fixed context toggle event handling

## Additional Improvements

### Enhanced Resource Link Styling
- Professional button-style resource links with hover effects
- External link indicators (↗ symbol)
- Consistent with VS Code design language
- Proper color schemes for light/dark themes

### Better Error Handling
- Structured error messages with clear visual hierarchy
- Retry functionality preserves user experience
- Loading states during retry operations
- Consistent error styling across the interface

### Code Quality
- Removed duplicate event handlers

- Improved event delegation patterns
- Better error boundary handling

## Technical Implementation

### Event Handling Improvements
```typescript
// Before: Inline onclick handlers
<button onclick="openInEditor()">

// After: Data-attribute based event delegation
<button data-action="open-file">
```

### Resource Links Integration
```typescript
// Added to detail view
const resourceLinks = buildResourceLinks(feature);
const resourceSection = resourceLinks.length > 0 ? `
  <div class="detail-section">
    <h4>Resources</h4>
    <ul class="resource-links">
      ${resourceLinks.map(link => convertToHTML(link)).join('')}
    </ul>
  </div>
` : "";
```

### Retry Functionality
```typescript
let lastFailedQuery = '';

// Store query for retry
lastFailedQuery = followUpQuestion;

// Retry handler
const retryButton = event.target.closest('.retry-query-button');
if (retryButton && lastFailedQuery) {
    // Retry with stored query
}
```

## Testing Results
