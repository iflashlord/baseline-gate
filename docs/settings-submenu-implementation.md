# Settings Submenu Implementation

## 🎯 What Was Added

Enhanced the existing settings button in the BaselineGate sidebar to provide a submenu with two options, making the factory reset feature easily accessible alongside the regular settings.

## 📋 User Interface Changes

### Before (Single Action)
```
[⚙️ Settings] → Opens VS Code settings directly
```

### After (Submenu with Options)
```
[⚙️ Settings] ▼
├── Open Settings          → Opens VS Code BaselineGate settings
└── Reset to Factory Settings → Performs complete factory reset
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Package.json Changes

1. **Added Submenu Definition**:
```json
"submenus": [
  {
    "id": "baseline-gate.settings",
    "label": "Settings",
    "icon": "$(settings-gear)"
  }
]
```

2. **Updated Menu Structure**:
```json
"menus": {
  "baseline-gate.settings": [
    {
      "command": "baseline-gate.openSettings",
      "group": "1_settings@1"
    },
    {
      "command": "baseline-gate.resetToFactory", 
      "group": "2_reset@1"
    }
  ],
  "view/title": [
    {
      "submenu": "baseline-gate.settings",
      "when": "view == baselineGate.analysisView",
      "group": "navigation@2",
      "icon": "$(settings-gear)"
    }
  ]
}
```

3. **Added Icon to Factory Reset Command**:
```json
{
  "command": "baseline-gate.resetToFactory",
  "title": "Reset BaselineGate to Factory Settings",
  "icon": "$(refresh)"
}
```

## 🎨 Visual Design

### Submenu Grouping
- **Group 1 (Settings)**: Regular configuration access
- **Group 2 (Reset)**: Factory reset functionality
- This creates a visual separation between normal settings and destructive actions

### Icons Used
- **Settings Button**: `$(settings-gear)` - Standard settings icon
- **Factory Reset**: `$(refresh)` - Refresh/reset icon to indicate restoration

## 🚀 User Experience Flow

### Accessing Settings
1. User clicks the **⚙️ Settings** button in BaselineGate sidebar
2. Dropdown menu appears with two options:
   - **Open Settings** - Opens VS Code settings for BaselineGate
   - **Reset to Factory Settings** - Triggers factory reset with confirmation

### Factory Reset Flow  
1. User selects "Reset to Factory Settings" from submenu
2. Confirmation dialog appears (same as before)
3. User confirms or cancels
4. If confirmed, complete reset is performed
