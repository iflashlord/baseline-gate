# Command Fix Summary

## Issue Fixed
**Error**: `command 'baselineGate.geminiView.focus' not found`

## Root Cause
The extension was trying to execute a command `baselineGate.geminiView.focus`, but this view doesn't exist in the extension manifest. The only registered view is `baselineGate.analysisView`.

## Files Modified

### 1. `/src/extension.ts` (Line 226)
**Before:**
```typescript
// Focus on the Gemini view and filter by the finding ID
await vscode.commands.executeCommand('baselineGate.geminiView.focus');
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Focus on the analysis view and filter by the finding ID
await vscode.commands.executeCommand('baselineGate.analysisView.focus');
```

### 2. `/src/gemini/geminiViewProvider.ts` (Line 90)
**Before:**
```typescript
// Focus the Gemini view to show the new suggestion
await vscode.commands.executeCommand('baselineGate.geminiView.focus');
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Focus the analysis view to show the new suggestion
await vscode.commands.executeCommand('baselineGate.analysisView.focus');
```

## Verification
- ✅ Extension compiles successfully without errors
- ✅ All 73 tests pass
- ✅ Webpack build completes successfully
- ✅ ESLint passes with no issues

## Context
This fix ensures that when the extension tries to focus on a view (typically after a Gemini suggestion is added), it correctly focuses the existing analysis view instead of trying to focus a non-existent Gemini view. The functionality remains the same - the user's attention is directed to the main analysis interface where they can see the Gemini suggestions and findings.

## Impact
- **User Experience**: No more error messages about missing commands
- **Functionality**: View focusing now works as intended
- **Stability**: Extension operates without command execution errors
