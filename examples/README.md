# BaselineGate Examples

Use these sample files to exercise the extension's BaselineGates:

- `baseline-demo.js` – includes `navigator.clipboard`, `URL.canParse`, and `Promise.any` snippets.
- `baseline-demo.ts` – TypeScript-flavoured versions of the same APIs.
- `styles.css` – provides `:has(...)`, `@container`, and `text-wrap:` usage in one stylesheet.

Open any of the files in VS Code, hover the highlighted tokens, and confirm the Baseline badge, support data, and status messaging appear as expected.
